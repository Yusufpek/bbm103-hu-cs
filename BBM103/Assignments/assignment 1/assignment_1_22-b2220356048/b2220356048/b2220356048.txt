I am Yusuf İpek. I am studying at Hacettepe University. This is my first year in Hacettepe University.
Also i like coding. I use c# for windows form applications development and flutter for mobile development.

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; I will not share my work (not even a part of it)
on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have
already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course
mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
